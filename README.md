# Portfolio Site

View deployed at [torihedden.com](http://torihedden.com/).

## About

Made simply with just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS! I stripped down this site to its essential components as a challenge and as a palate cleanser from the heavier work I need to use frameworks for.

## Dev Notes

Launch and reload on change(s) with:

`browser-sync start --server --files "assets" "index.html"`
